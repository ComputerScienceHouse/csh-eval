bootstrap-csh
=============

CSS overrides for [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), for use in [Computer Science House](http://csh.rit.edu) websites. 

Includes two themes:
* `public` - The "Hacker" theme (green), for CSH public sites
* `members` - The "PDP-11" theme (purple and pink), for internal CSH sites

Minified and compiled files can be found in the `release` directory. Original development files can be found in the `dev` directory. Example pages using both themes can be found in the `test` directory.

Learn more about Grunt: http://gruntjs.com

First, install grunt-cli: `npm install -g grunt-cli`

Next, install dependencies: `npm install`

Recommended grunt workflow:
* In one terminal window, run `grunt dev` to automatically compile and minify LESS files whenever a change is made to either theme.
* In another terminal window, run `grunt test` to spin up a web server and view your changes at `http://localhost:9000/public/` or `http://localhost:9000/members/`.

All available grunt tasks:
* `grunt` or `grunt default`: Compile LESS and minify CSS for both themes
* `grunt defaultMembers`: Compile LESS and minify CSS for the `members` theme only
* `grunt defaultPublic`: Compile LESS and minify CSS for the `public` theme only
* `grunt dev`: Compile LESS, minify CSS, and watch for changes in both themes
* `grunt devMembers` Compile LESS, minfiy CSS, and watch for changes in the `members` theme
* `grunt devPublic` Compile LESS, minfiy CSS, and watch for changes in the `public` theme
* `grunt test`: Spin up a local web server at `http://localhost:9000` to view the test pages
* `grunt testMembers`: Spin up a local web server and open the `members` test page at `http://localhost:9000/members/`
