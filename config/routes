-- Route definitions for the Evaluations Database frontend
-- This is where you add the routes for new HTML pages
-- The EvalAPI is defined as a subsite of this website, under the /api route.
-- Static files are placed under the /static route, also a subsite,
-- facilitated by the yesod-static package.

-- Before you add a new route here, check out the `frontend/README.md` file
-- for information on the full process of adding pages.

-- An example of a basic route definition is
--      /route/to/page NameOfRouteR GET
-- For more information on the syntax of route definitions, see the yesod book
-- chapter on routing (http://www.yesodweb.com/book/routing-and-handlers)

-- Sort your routes underneath the header for the file that the routes
-- corresponding headers will go, for clarity.
